# Fantasy Football Optimization Engine - Product Requirements Document

## 1. Executive Summary

**Product Name:** FantasyDraft Optimizer

**Elevator Pitch:** FantasyDraft Optimizer is an AI-powered platform that analyzes NFL player statistics and fantasy performance data to recommend the optimal draft picks and weekly lineup decisions. Our platform uses machine learning models to predict player performance and maximize fantasy points, giving users a statistical edge over traditional guesswork-based drafting.

**Core Problem:** Fantasy football players struggle to make data-driven draft decisions, often relying on opinions and gut feelings rather than statistical analysis, leading to suboptimal team performance and lost opportunities to win their leagues.

## 2. Problem Statement & Opportunity

### The Problem
Fantasy football has grown into a $7 billion industry with over 60 million players in the US alone. Despite this massive participation, most players rely on outdated methods for team building:

- **Opinion-based drafting**: Players depend on expert rankings that often contradict each other
- **Limited data analysis**: Most platforms provide basic stats without predictive modeling
- **Reactive decision making**: Users make lineup changes after poor performances rather than predicting them
- **Inconsistent success**: Even experienced players struggle with 50% accuracy in draft predictions

### Current Alternatives & Their Shortcomings
- **ESPN/Yahoo rankings**: Static, opinion-based, don't account for individual league dynamics
- **DraftKings/FanDuel tools**: Focus on daily fantasy, not season-long optimization
- **Generic fantasy advice sites**: Provide general tips without personalized recommendations
- **Manual research**: Time-consuming and prone to human bias

### Market Opportunity
The fantasy sports market is projected to reach $48.6 billion by 2027, with a growing demand for data-driven tools that provide competitive advantages.

## 7. Open Questions

1. **Monetization Strategy**: Should we start with a freemium model or charge from day one? What features should be premium vs. free?

2. **Data Licensing**: Which NFL data providers offer the best balance of cost, accuracy, and real-time updates for our prediction models?

3. **Target Market Focus**: Should we initially focus on casual players (easier to acquire) or serious players (higher willingness to pay)?

4. **Platform Integration**: Should we build standalone web app first, or prioritize integration with existing fantasy platforms like ESPN/Yahoo?

5. **Model Complexity**: How sophisticated should our initial prediction models be? Should we start simple and iterate, or invest in advanced ML from the beginning?

6. **Competitive Differentiation**: How can we differentiate from existing tools like FantasyPros or 4for4, and what unique value proposition will drive user adoption?
